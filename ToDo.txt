====Things to do for the Portofolio====
Marius:
//1. Create a video player that works on WebGL and in Editor.
//2. Create a simple portofolio grid. We will add the art, animations and content later.
//3. Add a simple parallax effect to the world layers in the Game scene.
//4. Make the Landing page work.
//5. Add a mouse parallax effect to the landing page. This still needs work.
//6. Create a cinematic transition for the portofolio grid in the game scene.
//7. Make the cv.pdf openable from the WebApp
//8. Portofolio grid
	//8.1 Make the scripted transition for it work
	//8.2 Make the fullscreen version work
	//8.3 Integrate the new graphical assets
	//8.4 Add the Portofolio Grid to the Landing page
	//8.5 Polish the Portofolio Grid
	//8.6 Polish the Categories Grid
9. Fix the image ghosting effect that occurs on camera movement.
10. Add functionality for the Contact page:
	10.1 Copy to clipboard for fields such as email, phone number etc
	//10.2 Message box that allows sending an email directly.
	10.3 Polish the animation and interaction.
//11. Category thumbnail images need to have a different "selected" animation (I've created the sprites, but because it's a prefab I cannot replace one image without replacing all of them)
12.The "Choose a category" bubble needs to show the name of the current category when one is selected.(the sprites are in Sprites - Text - CategoryBubble)
//13. The character needs to stop moving when it reaches the control page? (it moves when you write A/D:))
//14. We need to remove the arrows and radio buttons from the personal work grid in the landing page
15. Add the option to open the items from the grid in fullscreen.
16. Make the buttons from the video player auto-hide.
17. Display the web page loading animation.
18. Display the scene loading animation. 

Albu:

//2. Add the 3 triggers for the portofolio categories:
	//2.1 UI
	//2.2 Yacht skins
	//2.3 Personal projects
//3. Update the owl animation
//4. Navigation menu for the app. This must include buttons for:
	//4.1 Home
	//4.2 CV
	//4.3 Portofolio
	//4.4 Game
//5. In the Landing scene, add transition animation from the Categories to the Portofolio grid.
//6. Provide the sources for the Landing page art.
//7. Create the textures for the portofolio grid
	//7.1 Backgrounds.
	//7.2 Tiles.
	//7.3 Bullet scroll

//12. Polished landing page ( made category thumbnails smaller, grid bigger etc.)
//13. Added 2048 images for the tree, grass and rocks (PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THEY STILL SHOW BLURRY) - It's perfect now.
14. Create interaction element for the contact page
15. We need a loading animation to display while the web page is loading, before the "Made with Unity" logo is displayed.
	This can be a simple sprite sheet that "Loading...".
15. We also need a welcome animation for Landing Page.
	Somethings that says "Welcome to Anca Albu's interactive portfolio!"
16. Finally, we need something nice to show to the users reached the end of the game scene.
	This would be displayed after the Contact menu page, and it could say something like "Thanks for playing!"
	and have buttons for Home, Back to Start etc.
